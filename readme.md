## Lessons Learned
We have learned about HTML,CSS,Bootstrap 5 Express.JS . 
Also we decide to use JSON because it is a great format to store data, widely used in JavaScript .JSON is a file format that's used to store and interchange data. Data is stored in a set of key-value pairs. This data is human readable, which makes JSON perfect for manual editing.
